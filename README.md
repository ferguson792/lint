# LINT
> Version 0.1.0-bleeding0
> **WARNING:** This is a prototype. Proceed with caution and at your own risk.

For detailed documentation, see [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md).

At the moment, dummy processors are used to speed up development and enable rapid prototyping.
Nevertheless, the program already draws in and processes current information, meaning the summaries change
with the progress of time and new information drawn from the single testing source (a BBC newsfeed
about "Science and Environment"). The date for information-cutoff is always the current moment
(Python `datetime.now()`). The viewback timespan is always a period of 48 hours, from the current moment
(i.e. the last two days are being summarized).

## Running LINT

### Requirements
To run LINT, you need to have the following components installed on your system:

* Python 3.11 or higher
    * [Python Libraries](#python libraries); see below â†“

### Python Libraries
> For more information about libraries, view [`docs/libraries.md`](docs/libraries.md).

Before running LINT, make sure you have the required libraries installed.
To install them via `pip`, run
```sh
